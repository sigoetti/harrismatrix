# harris_matrix

A Harris Matrix creation tool

Apparently there's no free open source tool to create Harris Matrices as are used in archaeology for analyzing stratigraphy. The ones that are out there are either outdated or too expensive. So I thought I'll give it a try.
I'm using Flutter/Dart since it's as cross-platform as possible since the new version.
